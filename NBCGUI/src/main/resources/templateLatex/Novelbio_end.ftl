%========== DATABASE ==========
\section{DATABASE}

\subsection{Database information}
    \subsubsection{NovelBio Database:}
    Annotation is the base of the all bioinformatics analysis. At the beginning of the development of the bioinformatics analysis, websites including NCBI, EMBL, Uniprot/Swissprot have established their own database standard which had different Gene ID and annotations. Nevertheless, Affymetrix and Agilent Corp. have also developed their own Gene ID which caused great challenge on analyzing.\\

    NovelBio Annotation platform and ID convert module not only aggregates the Gene ID information from the known database including NCBI, EMBL, Uniprot/Swissprot, but applieds the batch blasting for the sequence with no annotation to contact as much as possible function with Gene ID, which can help the client to achieve the comprehensive gene symbol annotation information for the further analysis.

    \subsubsection{Reference Database:}
    \paragraph{NCBI:}
    \href{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/}{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/}\\
    NCBI is a database mainly used to search for the gene information, related articles, protein interaction, gene ontology and pathway information.
    \paragraph{The Gene ontology:}
    \href{http://www.geneontology.org/}{http://www.geneontology.org/}\\
    The Gene ontology is a database mainly used to search for the gene ontology information including the biological process, molecular function and cellular component, the relationship between the gene ontologies and the genes in the gene ontology.
    \paragraph{KEGG:}
    \href{http://www.genome.jp/kegg/}{http://www.genome.jp/kegg/}\\
    KEGG is a database mainly used to search for the pathway information and the relationship between different pathway of genes.
    \paragraph{TIGR:}
    \href{http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1/}{http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1/}\\
    TIGR (The Institute of Genomic Research Database-TDB) is one of the world's most important sequencing centers which applied the comparative genomics and artificial genomics research.
    \paragraph{miRBase:}
    \href{http://www.mirbase.org/}{http://www.mirbase.org/}\\
    miRBase sequencing database is essential database which published the microRNA sequence and annotation information.
