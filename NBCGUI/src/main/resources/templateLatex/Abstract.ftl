\subsection{ABSTRACT.}
\paragraph{Raw Data Treatment:} Using high-throughput ${sequence}, the transcript with poly (A)+ RNA of ${SpeciesName} were analyzed. Reads sequenced were filtered and mapped to ${SpeciesName} genome (download from NCBI) using ${software} software. The mapped reads was counted to achieve the expression of each gene based on the gene annotation information from NCBI database.
\paragraph{Preliminary Analysis:} The differentially expressed genes were achieved by ${algrithm} algorithms and annotated by NCBI Database and by blasting to ${blastSpeciesName} protein sequence of the transcripts. Based on the differentially expressed gene, we applied the Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis and Pathway Analysis to discover the function and pathway enriched among the differentially expressed gene.
\paragraph{In-Depth Analysis: }Series Cluster Analysis was introduced to discover the expression trend of differentially expressed gene in different strains of grape from 0d, 1d to 7d. GO Analysis and Pathway Analysis was applied towards the gene with different expression trend. Venn Analysis was introduced towards the ${samples} group to discover the genes' expression trend difference. GO Analysis, Pathway Analysis and Co-Expression-Network was done to discover the core gene among the gene with different trends. Alternative Splicing Analysis result was achieved to discover the alternative splicing difference in different sample. Venn Analysis on Alternative Splicing was also committed to discover the difference between ${samples}.
