Usage: java -jar -Xmx10000m cash.jar <--options> --Case:prefixCase file1.bam,file2.bam --Control:prefixControl file3.bam,file4.bam --GTF gtfFile.gtf --Output outPath
Example: java -jar -Xmx10000m cash.jar --DisplayAllEvent True --StrandSpecific F  --Case:Mutation file1.bam,file2.bam --Control:WildType file3.bam,file4.bam --GTF hg19.gtf --Output outPath
Input:
--Case:prefixCase  case bam files, using comma to seperate files
	just like --Case:Treatment  /home/user/case1.bam,/home/user/case2.bam
--Control:prefixControl  control bam files, using comma to seperate files
	just like --Control:WT  /home/user/wt1.bam,/home/user/wt2.bam
--GTF file.gtf
	CASH needs reference gene annotation (eg. gtf/gff file) and RNA-seq data to construct alternative splicing (AS) model within genes

Output:
--Output outFilePrefix
	output prefix, example:  --Output /home/user/myresult

Options:
--Combine True/False,  default is False
	True: if here are several case(control) bam files, CASH can combine case(control) bam files together and just treat them as one big bam file
	False: if here are several case(control) bam files, CASH will treat them as biological replicates

--DisplayAllEvent  True/False,  default is True
	a gene may have several splicing events on different exons, CASH can display all events of a gene, or just show only one most significant event
	True: show all splicing event
	False: show only one most significant splicing event

--StrandSpecific F/R/NONE,  default is NONE
	if the sequence library is strand specific, CASH can use this option to gain more precise result
	F: first read of the pair-end reads represent the strand of the fragment, just like ion proton
	R: second read of the pair-end reads represent the strand of the fragment

--Reconstruct True/False,  default is TRUE
	CASH can reconstruct AS gene model and detect AS events not included in gff/gtf file.
	True: reconstruct AS gene model based on the input gtf/gff file and the mapping bam files. The process needs more time.
	False: employ AS gene model inferred from the input gtf/gff file.
 
--JuncAllSample int,  default is 25
	doesn't calculate AS event with the sum of all sample junction reads less than JuncAllSample
--JuncOneGroup int,  default is 10
	doesn't calculate AS event with one group of junction reads less than JuncOneGroup

--minAnchorLen/-A  int,  default is 5
	when counting junction reads, exon-exon junctions spanned by reads with at least this many bases on each side
--minIntronLen/-I  int,  default is 25
	The gaps between RNA-Seq reads with length > 25bp is considered to be intron
--minJuncReadsForNewIso/-J  int,  default is 10
	min junction reads for reconstruct AS site
